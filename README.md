# GAN_MLP
Optimizing GANs for construction of 2D crystal structures using machine learned potentials

Jupyter Noteboks 2D_GAN_Stage_*.ipynb details stage I, II, and III of training.

Juypter Notebook C2DB_CGCNN provides code for training CGCNN model used as bandgap discriminator in stage III. 

Juypter Notebook TrainCHGNET provides code for fine tuning CHGNet used as discriminator for phonon dos in stage III. 

Voxel_Image_Create provides code to produce and decode 2D crystal images for use in network.
